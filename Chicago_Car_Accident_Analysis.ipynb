    "**Overview:** The intent of this project is to build a classifier to predict the primary contributory cause of car accidents in Chicago, based on factors such as vehicle type, driver demographics, and road conditions. The findings of this analysis will help the City of Chicago understand continutors to accidents and assist with implimenting policies through the  Vehicle Safety Board that aim to reduce car accidents and increase the safety of Chicago residents. \n",

    "For modeling, we're going to use Logistic Regression as our baseline model since we are trying to predict a binary outcome of certain parameters highly correlate to the whether an injury occured from a car crash (INJURY_CLASSIFICATION_BINARY). For the second model, we will use Decision Trees to help us understand which parameters are the most important contributors to a car crash. Based on our initial findings, tunning and interations we will compare which model is the most accurate for predicting injuries attained in a crash and which variables are the highest contributing factors  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression ###\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason:** Logistic regression is a great baseline model and computationally efficient. Since we have a larger dataset and a mixture of binary and multiclass parameters, we can efficiently process and train our dataset to understand which categories are not highly correlated and verify if we are under/overfitting, undersampling or have class imbalance. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics and Analysis:** The metrics we're going to evaluate during this process are the following \n",
    "\n",
    "* Coefficients: understanding which parameters have a high positive/negative correlation whether a car accident results in a crash. For example, if TRAFFIC_CONTROL_DEVICE shows a strong negative correlation then this might direct policy and funding for Chicago to add more traffic control devices in the city.\n",
    "* Classification Reporing: understanding how accurate the predictions are (accuracy), how often predicted true positives are correct (recall) and mean between precision/recall (F1-Score) which will help us understand if there is class imbalance in our dataset that we need to account for. \n",
    "* Confusion Matrix: we will use to verify how often our model correctly classify true positive/negatives against false positives/negatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Tree ###\n",
    "**Reason:**\n",
    "Non-linear Relationships: Decision Trees handle non-linear interactions well, which is valuable in a dataset with mixed data types (categorical, numerical) and potentially complex interactions, like between WEATHER_CONDITION, DRIVER_ACTION, and INJURY_CLASSIFICATION.\n",
    "Handling Missing Values and Outliers: Decision Trees are robust to missing values and outliers, which are often present in real-world datasets like crash data.\n",
    "**Metrics and Analysis**\n",
    "Feature Importance: Decision Trees provide an intrinsic measure of feature importance, which helps in identifying the most significant variables influencing the outcome (e.g., whether specific vehicle types or driver actions are risk factors).\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy Interpretation: The tree structure provides a clear, visual representation of how decisions are made based on feature splits, making it easy to explain to non-technical stakeholders.\n",
    "Flexible and Robust: Decision Trees can capture complex patterns and dependencies within the data without requiring extensive feature engineering or data scaling.\n",
    "Summary of Using Both Models\n",
    "Combining Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models offers a comprehensive approach. Logistic Regression provides a baseline and interpretability, helping identify linear relationships between features and the target variable. Decision Trees, on the other hand, offer robustness to non-linearity and provide insights into feature interactions, allowing for a more complex understanding of crash risk factors. These models complement each other, making them ideal choices for initial predictive analysis on this crash dataset. ​"

    "* Stakeholder: Choose a stakeholder, like the Chicago Department of Transportation, insurance companies, or a public safety organization.\n",
    "* Business Problem: Define a goal, such as predicting the likelihood of different crash types (e.g., severe injury vs. minor incidents) based on vehicle type and driver demographics.\n",
    "* Objective: Create a model to predict crash types to improve safety measures, allocate resources, or optimize insurance premiums.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Dataset Selection and Initial Data Exploration\n",
    "Select and Load Data:\n",
    "* Obtain data on car crashes in Chicago with fields for vehicle type, driver type, crash outcomes, and other relevant factors.\n",

    "Step 3: Business and Data Understanding\n",
    "Business Understanding:\n",
    "* Frame how predicting crash types serves your stakeholders.\n",

    "* Encoding and Scaling:\n",
    "* Encode categorical data (e.g., vehicle type, driver type) using One-Hot or Label Encoding.\n",
    "* Scale data if using models like logistic regression that are sensitive to feature scale.\n",
    "* Train-Test Split:\n",
    "* Split data into training and test sets to prevent data leakage.\n",

    "Step 5: Baseline Modeling\n",
    "Choose Baseline Model:\n",
    "* Start with a simple, interpretable model like logistic regression or a decision tree.\n",

    "Iterate on Model:\n",
    "* Test a nonparametric model (e.g., decision tree, random forest) or ensemble method to improve performance.\n",
    "* Use cross-validation to evaluate model reliability on different subsets of data.\n",
    "Tune Hyperparameters:\n",
    "* Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., tree depth, regularization) to optimize model performance.\n",
    "* Compare model metrics and select the best model configuration.\n",
    "Feature Importance and Selection:\n",
    "* For models like random forests, evaluate feature importance.\n",

    "Step 7: Final Model Selection and Evaluation\n",
    "Evaluate Final Model:\n",
    "* Use metrics aligned with stakeholder needs (e.g., F1-score for class balance, recall for safety-critical predictions).\n",
    "* Validate final model performance on test data and summarize results.\n",
    "Model Limitations:\n",
    "* Identify contexts where the model may be less reliable (e.g., underrepresented driver types or crash types).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 8: Findings, Recommendations, and Business Insights\n",
    "Interpret Findings:\n",
    "* Summarize model insights (e.g., higher risks for specific vehicle/driver types).\n",
    "Provide Recommendations:\n",
    "* Recommend actions stakeholders can take based on model predictions, such as targeting high-risk vehicle types with specific interventions.\n",
    "Define Next Steps:\n",
    "* Suggest next steps, such as gathering additional data or implementing the model in a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 9: Non-Technical Presentation\n",
    "Create Slide Deck:\n",
    "*Beginning: Introduce the business problem, stakeholder, and project goals.\n",
    "*Middle: Summarize the modeling process and key metrics without technical jargon.\n",
    "*End: Provide findings, recommendations, and next steps in a business-friendly language.\n",
    "Practice Delivery:\n",
    "*Prepare to explain classification, metrics, and feature importance simply to a non-technical audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 10: Jupyter Notebook and GitHub Repository\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "*Organize code into sections for Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, and Evaluation.\n",
    "Include markdown cells for explanations, rationale for model choices, and results analysis.\n",
    "GitHub Repository:\n",
    "*Structure repository with a clean README.md, explaining the project overview, methodology, and findings.\n",
    "*Include Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and export it as a PDF for submission.\n",
    "Keep repository updated with version history for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 11: Submission and Review\n",
    "Ensure Deliverables:\n",
    "*Confirm that your GitHub repo, Jupyter Notebook, and non-technical presentation cover all required elements.\n",
    "Review and Iterate:\n",
    "*Self-review based on the grading rubric and make final adjustments to meet or exceed project expectations.\n",
    "Following these steps will help ensure your analysis, model building, and presentation are robust and aligned with project requirements for both technical and non-technical audiences. Let me know if you need specific help with any of the phases, such as coding tips, visualization strategies, or evaluation metrics!"
